Hello :wave:, I am migrating my old blog's contents here. I honestly do not know when migration will be completed. I hope to finish in just a few days but knowing me I could take weeks, months or years! :kissing_closed_eyes:
In the meantime I introduce myself whether you do not know who I am (very likely if you are not a friend or relative). 

I hardly know where to begin so I would start defining myself as a nerd: I love videogames, sci-fi books but also fantasy and comics, I am an avid science work reader and I still enjoy playing with Legos, in particular Technic or Star Wars. To recap I am obsessed with all that's related to science and technology. Maybe surprisingly, I am fond of sports too. I am a cyclist, I own a very cool MTB, and sometimes I play football as well. I also enjoy travelling, more of a museum than a beach type though. 

Last but not least my greatest passion is... computer science, in particular everything about coding. I am a software developer with more than 10 years experience. I'm currently developing solutions for software testing, from APIs to web sites for a leading Europe bank. I aspire (work) to integrate machine learning techniques in our daily living.

Marco
